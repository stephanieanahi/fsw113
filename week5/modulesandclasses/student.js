// Create a class called Student whose constructor maintains all four data inputs from the HTML page.
// The class should also contain the following methods:
// - a method that adds up all the student's scores
// - a method that adds up all the possible scores
// - a method that calculates the student's letter grade (divide the student's score by the possible scores and use the resulting decimal to determine grade)

    constructor(studentName,className,studentScores,possibleScores){
    this.studentName=studentName
    this.className=className
    this.studentScores=studentScores
